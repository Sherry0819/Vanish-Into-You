# Privacy Model

- Raw texts and legacy bundle contents remain **off-chain**.
- On-chain stores only: pointers (CID/URL), hashes, and policy metadata.
- Decryption keys should be encrypted for beneficiaries (or split with secret sharing).
- Access should be revocable during the owner's lifetime and within challenge windows.
