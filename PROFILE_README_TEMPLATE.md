# Vanish Into You — Digital Legacy Protocol

Hi, I’m **Sherry Zhao**. I build research-driven systems at the intersection of **DeFi**, **security**, and **applied AI**.

## Flagship Project: Vanish Into You
A decentralized digital legacy protocol that manages:

- **On-chain inheritance** (ETH/ERC-20/NFT vault distribution with safety controls)
- **Off-chain legacy delivery** (encrypted bundles for accounts, works, and personal data)
- **Digital Profile** (language-based portrait + style-aware writing, with explicit ethics & privacy constraints)

### Why it matters
Digital assets and digital life can be lost due to sudden events, inactivity, or credential loss. Vanish Into You provides a structured, privacy-first mechanism to transfer value and context to loved ones — without exposing sensitive data on-chain.

### Key Ideas
- Smart contracts decide **when** access unlocks (inactivity/attestation/joint notice + challenge window)
- Off-chain modules deliver **what** unlocks (encrypted bundle + AI portrait)
- “No consciousness replication”: identity representation is *interpretable, sourced, and bounded*

### What’s in the repo
- Solidity design skeletons (`InheritanceVault`, `LegacyRegistry`)
- Python Digital Profile pipeline (profile JSON + memorial portrait + style writer)
- Threat model, privacy model, ethics statement, and research-style motivation
